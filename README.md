In this tutorial you will be writing code to implement a skip list insert.  This tutorial is designed to give you some experience with a randomised data structure, as well as to give you more practice working with linked lists.

<h1>Skip List</h1>

You will find a zipped project file with this tutorial.  The project file contains a partial skip list implementation.  Your task is to complete it.

Start with the insert function.  Your tutor will give some hints for this function at the beginning of the tutorial.  Once you have this working you should be able to run the program and confirm that it is correct.

If you have time try and write the delete function.
